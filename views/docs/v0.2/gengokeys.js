        "#setup": "Setting up your dictionary is uber easy. By default, gengo uses XML and JSON simultaneously. Of course, XML is optional and will not affect gengo if you decide to only use JSON.",
        "#momentjs-and-numeraljs": "Another great feature is the use of Moment.js and Numeral.js. Since they are both built into gengo, you can use it without worrying about changing its locale and language. Also, if you do want to change the locale or language but still want to use gengo’s current language, then it is as easy as using the browser version of Moment.js and Numeral.js along with gengo’s Moment.js and Numeral.js.",
        "#sprintf": "What makes gengo great is its built in Sprintf.js support. You can replace strings with a simple syntax. gengo supports majority of what the Sprintf.js has but only to the exception of multiple arguments."
